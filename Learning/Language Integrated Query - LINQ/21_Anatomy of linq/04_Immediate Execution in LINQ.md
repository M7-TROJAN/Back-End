# Immediate Execution in LINQ

This code demonstrates the concept of immediate execution in LINQ. Immediate execution means that the data source is read and the operation is performed at the point in the code where the query is declared.

## Code

```csharp
private static void DemoImmediateExecution()
{
    // Immediate: the data source is read and the operation is performed 
    //            at the point in the code where the query is declared.
    
    // not up to date
    // not expensive to call
    // lists are big
    
    var numbers = new int[] { 8, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 7, 9 };
    var list = numbers
        .Where(x => x > 5)                       // 8, 6, 7, 9  
        .Take(2)                                 // 8, 6 
        .ToList();

    foreach (var n in list)
        Console.WriteLine(n);
}
```

## Explanation

### Immediate Execution

Immediate execution means that the query is executed as soon as it is declared. This contrasts with deferred execution, where the query is only executed when the data is actually iterated over. Methods that force immediate execution include `ToList`, `ToArray`, `Count`, `Sum`, `Max`, `Min`, `Average`, and others.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Initial Array**:
    ```csharp
    var numbers = new int[] { 8, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5, 7, 9 };
    ```
    - An array of integers is defined.

2. **LINQ Query with Immediate Execution**:
    ```csharp
    var list = numbers
        .Where(x => x > 5)                       // 8, 6, 7, 9  
        .Take(2)                                 // 8, 6 
        .ToList();
    ```
    - **Where**: Filters numbers greater than 5. The resulting sequence is `{ 8, 6, 7, 9 }`.
    - **Take(2)**: Takes the first 2 elements from the filtered sequence. The resulting sequence is `{ 8, 6 }`.
    - **ToList**: Converts the sequence to a `List<int>`, causing immediate execution of the query.

3. **Output**:
    ```csharp
    foreach (var n in list)
        Console.WriteLine(n);
    ```
    - Iterates over the list and prints each number.

### Key Points

- **Immediate Execution**: The `ToList` method causes the query to be executed immediately, and the resulting list is stored in memory.
- **Performance Considerations**: Immediate execution can be beneficial when you need to store the results for later use or when working with large data sets that you want to avoid querying multiple times.
- **Current State of Data**: Since the query is executed immediately, the results reflect the state of the data source at the point of execution. Subsequent changes to the data source will not affect the results stored in the list.

### Summary

This example demonstrates the concept of immediate execution in LINQ. By using methods like `ToList`, you can force the query to execute immediately, storing the results for later use. Understanding when to use immediate execution versus deferred execution is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring the correct behavior of your queries.
