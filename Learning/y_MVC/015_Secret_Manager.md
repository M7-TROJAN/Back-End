The **ASP.NET Core Secret Manager** is a tool for securely storing sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets, outside of your source code. It allows you to keep sensitive configuration data out of your codebase and safely store it in a local environment during development.

This tool is especially helpful when working in a team or managing projects with source control (like Git), where you want to avoid storing sensitive information in the code that could be accidentally shared.

## 1. Setting Up the Secret Manager

The Secret Manager tool works by creating a `secrets.json` file stored outside of the project directory, typically in a user-specific directory on the local machine. To get started with Secret Manager in an ASP.NET Core project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable Secret Storage for Your Project

1. **Initialize User Secrets**: Open a command prompt (cmd) in the folder where your project’s `.csproj` file is located.
2. Run the command:
   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets init
   ```
   
   This command does the following:
   - Adds a `UserSecretsId` property with a unique GUID to the `.csproj` file.
   - The GUID links the project to the `secrets.json` file created by Secret Manager.

   ### Example:
   After running `dotnet user-secrets init`, your `.csproj` file will look like this:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
     <UserSecretsId>79a3edd0-2092-40a2-a04d-dcb46d5ca9ed</UserSecretsId>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

   The `UserSecretsId` is a unique identifier for linking your project to its `secrets.json` file in your file system.

### Step 2: Finding the Secret Storage Location

The `secrets.json` file is stored in a directory at:
```
%APPDATA%\Microsoft\UserSecrets\<UserSecretsId>\secrets.json
```
To navigate to this location:
- Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
- Type `%APPDATA%\Microsoft` and press Enter.
- Find the `UserSecrets` folder, and within it, locate the folder named after your `UserSecretsId`.

## 2. Adding and Managing Secrets

Once Secret Manager is initialized, you can start adding secrets. You will store secrets as key-value pairs (similar to JSON format). Here’s how to add secrets:

### Setting a Secret

To set a secret, use the command:
```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "<Key>" "<Value>"
```

**Example Command:**
```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret" "Vf8lSFk_w5NX6TeU2k1H_RZaJGA"
```

**Explanation**:
- `CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret`: This is the key name for the secret, written in a nested configuration format. Here, `CloudinarySettings` is the section, and `ApiSecret` is the key inside that section.
- `Vf8lSFk_w5NX6TeU2k1H_RZaJGA`: This is the actual value of the secret.

### Viewing and Editing Secrets

- To view or manually edit secrets, go to **Visual Studio**, right-click on the project name, and select **Manage User Secrets**. This will open the `secrets.json` file, where secrets are stored in the following format:

   ```json
   {
     "CloudinarySettings:ApiKey": "123456789",
     "CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret": "Vf8lSFk_w5NX6TeU2k1H_RZaJGA",
     "CloudinarySettings:Cloud": "sampleCloudName"
   }
   ```

- **Note**: Any changes made directly in `secrets.json` are immediately saved and will override any conflicting settings within the application’s configuration.

## 3. Accessing Secrets in Code

Once secrets are added, they can be accessed in your application just like other configuration settings.

### Loading Secrets with Dependency Injection

1. First, add the Secret Manager to the `Configuration` in your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file:

   ```csharp
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   
   builder.Configuration.AddUserSecrets<Program>();
   ```

2. Now, the secrets can be injected into a service or controller as follows:

   ```csharp
   public class CloudinaryService
   {
       private readonly string _cloudinaryApiSecret;
       
       public CloudinaryService(IConfiguration configuration)
       {
           _cloudinaryApiSecret = configuration["CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret"];
       }
   }
   ```

   - Here, `configuration["CloudinarySettings:ApiSecret"]` retrieves the value of the `ApiSecret` key within the `CloudinarySettings` section from `secrets.json`.

## 4. Why Use the Secret Manager?

- **Security**: It prevents hard-coding sensitive information, such as API keys or connection strings, directly in your application’s source code.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Since secrets are stored locally on each developer’s machine, they can be environment-specific (development, staging, etc.) without needing to alter the application code.
- **Ease of Use**: It’s simple to add, update, and retrieve secrets without affecting the main configuration files or accidentally exposing them in source control.

## 5. Best Practices with Secret Manager

- **Do Not Use Secret Manager in Production**: Secret Manager is designed only for development. In production, use a secure key vault service, such as **Azure Key Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- **Keep Secrets Out of Version Control**: Since secrets are stored outside of the project directory, they are not included in the repository by default.
- **Regularly Rotate Secrets**: For security, periodically change secrets such as API keys, especially after each major release or role changes within a team.

By following these steps and practices, you’ll ensure that sensitive information remains secure and your development environment stays organized and manageable.
