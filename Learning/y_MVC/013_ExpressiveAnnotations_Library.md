### **ExpressiveAnnotations: Comprehensive Documentation**

#### **Overview**
**ExpressiveAnnotations** is an open-source library for .NET that enhances **data annotation attributes** in C# by allowing complex validation rules written in a concise and natural language expression syntax. This library simplifies validation logic by utilizing expressions rather than writing custom validation attributes or server-side checks.

It is commonly used in **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **ASP.NET MVC** projects to add client-side and server-side validation for form inputs. You can write flexible, expressive conditions directly in your data annotations, which means complex validation logic can be added in a declarative manner.

#### **Key Features**
1. **Declarative Validation Logic**: Write complex validation expressions using simple, readable syntax.
2. **Client-Side Validation**: Automatically translates server-side expressions into JavaScript for client-side validation.
3. **Flexible Expression Syntax**: Supports a wide range of operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`, etc.) and functions (`Len()`, `RegexMatch()`, etc.).
4. **Seamless Integration**: Integrates well with ASP.NET MVC validation pipelines for both server and client-side validation.
5. **Custom Error Messages**: Allows defining dynamic, custom error messages based on validation logic.
6. **Field Dependencies**: Validate fields based on the values of other fields in the model.

---

#### **Installation**

To install the ExpressiveAnnotations package, you can use **NuGet**. Run the following command in the **NuGet Package Manager Console**:

```bash
Install-Package ExpressiveAnnotations
```

Alternatively, for **.NET Core** projects, you can use the **dotnet CLI**:

```bash
dotnet add package ExpressiveAnnotations
```

Once installed, you can start using the expressive validation attributes in your models.

---

#### **Registering ExpressiveAnnotations in Program.cs**

To use ExpressiveAnnotations in an ASP.NET Core project, itâ€™s essential to register the library within **Program.cs**. Without this registration, ExpressiveAnnotations will not be activated for validation purposes, resulting in errors. To register, add the following line within your service configuration in **Program.cs**:

```csharp
// Add ExpressiveAnnotations
builder.Services.AddExpressiveAnnotations();
```

This line should be placed in the **ConfigureServices** section, which sets up dependency injection and middleware for your application. Once added, ExpressiveAnnotations will be ready to handle validations specified in your models.

--- 

#### **Key Attributes**
1. **[AssertThat]**: Validates a condition that must evaluate to `true` for the validation to pass.
2. **[RequiredIf]**: Requires a field to be filled in if a certain condition evaluates to `true`.

---

#### **Usage of ExpressiveAnnotations**

##### **1. [AssertThat]**
The `[AssertThat]` attribute validates that a condition is `true` for the model to be valid. It allows the creation of complex validation logic by evaluating fields within an expression.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
[AssertThat("expression", ErrorMessage = "Your custom error message.")]
```

**Example:**
```csharp
public class ProductViewModel
{
    public decimal Price { get; set; }

    [AssertThat("Price >= 0", ErrorMessage = "The price must be a positive number.")]
    public decimal DiscountPrice { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `DiscountPrice` must be a positive number for the model to be valid.

##### **2. [RequiredIf]**
The `[RequiredIf]` attribute makes a field required if the condition is satisfied. This attribute is useful for making fields conditionally required based on other field values.

**Syntax:**
```csharp
[RequiredIf("expression", ErrorMessage = "This field is required if the condition is met.")]
```

**Example:**
```csharp
public class BookingViewModel
{
    public bool IsInternational { get; set; }

    [RequiredIf("IsInternational == true", ErrorMessage = "Passport number is required for international bookings.")]
    public string PassportNumber { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, the `PassportNumber` field is only required if `IsInternational` is set to `true`.

#### **Common Expression Syntax and Built-In Functions**

Here are some common operators and functions you can use within expressions:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

---

#### **Built-In Functions**

ExpressiveAnnotations offers several built-in functions that can be used within expressions to create complex validation rules:

1. **Len(field)**: Returns the length of a string.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("Len(Name) > 5", ErrorMessage = "Name must be longer than 5 characters.")]
      public string Name { get; set; }
      ```

2. **RegexMatch(field, pattern)**: Checks if the value of a string field matches a regular expression pattern.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("RegexMatch(Email, '^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$')", ErrorMessage = "Invalid email format.")]
      public string Email { get; set; }
      ```

3. **Now()**: Returns the current date and time.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("DateOfBirth <= Now()", ErrorMessage = "Date of Birth cannot be in the future.")]
      public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
      ```

4. **Date(field)**: Extracts the date part from a DateTime field, ignoring the time component.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("Date(BookingDate) >= Date(Now())", ErrorMessage = "Booking date cannot be in the past.")]
      public DateTime BookingDate { get; set; }
      ```

5. **IsNull(field)**: Checks if the field is null.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("!IsNull(Address)", ErrorMessage = "Address must be provided.")]
      public string Address { get; set; }
      ```

6. **IsEmpty(field)**: Checks if the field is an empty string.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("!IsEmpty(Username)", ErrorMessage = "Username cannot be empty.")]
      public string Username { get; set; }
      ```

7. **Contains(container, item)**: Checks if the container (list, array, or string) contains a specific item.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("Contains(UserRoles, 'Admin')", ErrorMessage = "User must have the Admin role.")]
      public List<string> UserRoles { get; set; }
      ```

8. **Count(field)**: Returns the count of items in a list or array.
    - **Example**:
      ```csharp
      [AssertThat("Count(Items) > 0", ErrorMessage = "At least one item must be selected.")]
      public List<string> Items { get; set; }
      ```

---

#### **Client-Side Validation**

ExpressiveAnnotations supports automatic **client-side validation**. When using the library in an ASP.NET Core MVC or ASP.NET MVC project, the validation logic written in C# is automatically translated into JavaScript, so it runs on the client side as well.

To enable client-side validation:

1. **Ensure that jQuery and jQuery Unobtrusive Validation are loaded** on the page (these are already included in ASP.NET MVC projects).
2. ExpressiveAnnotations' client-side validation scripts are required:
   
   Add the following script references in your `_Layout.cshtml` or in the specific view where you want validation:

   ```html
   <script src="~/Scripts/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
   <script src="~/Scripts/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
   <script src="~/Scripts/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js"></script>
   <script src="~/Scripts/expressive.annotations.validate.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Ensure validation is enabled** by adding the following in the view:

   ```html
   @Html.ValidationSummary(true)
   @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery")
   @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")
   ```

Now, validation will occur both on the server and on the client side, reducing round trips for invalid data.

#### **Example: Complete Model Using ExpressiveAnnotations**

```csharp
public class UserViewModel
{
    public string Username { get; set; }

    [Required(ErrorMessage = "Email is required.")]
    [AssertThat("RegexMatch(Email, '^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$')", ErrorMessage = "Invalid email format.")]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    public bool IsAdmin { get; set; }

    [RequiredIf("IsAdmin == true", ErrorMessage = "Admin privileges require an access code.")]
    public string? AccessCode { get; set; }

    [AssertThat("Len(Password) >= 8", ErrorMessage = "Password must be at least 8 characters long.")]
    public string Password { get; set; }

    [AssertThat("Password == ConfirmPassword", ErrorMessage = "Passwords do not match.")]
    public string ConfirmPassword { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Email` field must be a valid email format.
- The `AccessCode` field is required only if `IsAdmin` is true.
- The `Password` must be at least 8 characters long and must match the `ConfirmPassword`.

---

#### **Limitations**

While ExpressiveAnnotations provides great flexibility, there are a few limitations:
- It does not support cross-model validation (i.e., validation that spans across multiple models).
- Complex validation logic can become difficult to maintain if overused within annotations.

---

### **

Conclusion**

ExpressiveAnnotations is a powerful library for enhancing validation logic in .NET applications, especially in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core. It allows you to write complex validation rules using expressive syntax, which can significantly reduce the need for custom validation logic and simplify your codebase. The integration with client-side validation ensures that users receive instant feedback when they input invalid data, improving user experience.
