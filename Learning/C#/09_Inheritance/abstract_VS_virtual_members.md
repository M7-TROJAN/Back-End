In C#, both abstract and virtual members allow a class to define methods or properties that can be overridden in derived classes. However, there are key differences between abstract and virtual members in terms of their implementation and usage.

### Abstract Members
1. **Definition Only**: An abstract member provides no implementation in the base class. It only defines the signature of the method or property.
2. **Must be Overridden**: Any derived class must override the abstract member, providing a concrete implementation.
3. **Abstract Classes**: Abstract members can only be declared within abstract classes. An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly.
4. **No Body**: Abstract methods do not have a method body in the abstract class.

Example:
```csharp
public abstract class Shape
{
    // Abstract method
    public abstract double GetArea();
}

public class Circle : Shape
{
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius)
    {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    // Overriding abstract method
    public override double GetArea()
    {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}
```

### Virtual Members
1. **Default Implementation**: A virtual member provides a default implementation in the base class.
2. **May be Overridden**: Derived classes have the option to override virtual members, but it is not mandatory.
3. **Concrete or Abstract Classes**: Virtual members can be declared in both abstract and non-abstract classes.
4. **Method Body**: Virtual methods have a method body in the base class.

Example:
```csharp
public class Animal
{
    // Virtual method
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    // Overriding virtual method
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    // Not overriding the virtual method
    // Will use the default implementation from the base class
}
```

### Key Differences

1. **Implementation in Base Class**:
   - Abstract members do not have an implementation in the base class. They must be overridden in derived classes.
   - Virtual members have an implementation in the base class. Derived classes can choose to override them.

2. **Requirement to Override**:
   - Abstract members must be overridden in any non-abstract derived class.
   - Virtual members can be overridden, but it is not mandatory.

3. **Class Type**:
   - Abstract members can only be declared in abstract classes.
   - Virtual members can be declared in both abstract and non-abstract classes.

### When to Use
- **Abstract Members**: Use abstract members when you want to ensure that all derived classes provide a specific implementation for the method or property. This is useful when the base class cannot provide a meaningful implementation.
- **Virtual Members**: Use virtual members when you want to provide a default implementation that can be optionally overridden by derived classes. This allows you to provide common functionality while still allowing customization in derived classes.

By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate member type based on the needs of your class hierarchy and the behavior you want to enforce in derived classes.
