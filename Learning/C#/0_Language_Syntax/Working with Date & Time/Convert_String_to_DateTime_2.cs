/*
The methods  (Parse, ParseExact, TryParse, and TryParseExact) are used for parsing strings into other data types, primarily DateTime objects.
Each method serves a different purpose and has its own advantages and use cases:

Parse Method:
    - The Parse method is used to convert a string representation of a date and time into a DateTime object.
    - It throws an exception (FormatException) if the string cannot be parsed according to the expected format.
    - Example: 
        DateTime parsedDate = DateTime.Parse("2023-08-29");

ParseExact Method:
    - The ParseExact method is similar to Parse, but it allows you to specify a specific format string that the input string must match.
    - It throws an exception (FormatException) if the input string doesn't match the specified format.
    - Example: 
        DateTime parsedDate = DateTime.ParseExact("08/29/2023", "MM/dd/yyyy", null);

TryParse Method:
    - The TryParse method attempts to parse a string representation of a date and time into a DateTime object.
    - It returns a Boolean value indicating whether the parsing was successful or not.
    - If successful, the parsed DateTime is stored in an output parameter.
    - It's safer to use than Parse because it doesn't throw an exception for parsing failures.
    - Example:
        string input = "2023-08-29";
        if (DateTime.TryParse(input, out DateTime parsedDate))
        {
            "Parsing successful, use parsedDate"
        }

TryParseExact Method:
    - The TryParseExact method is similar to TryParse, but it allows you to specify a specific format string that the input string must match.
    - It returns a Boolean value indicating whether the parsing was successful or not.
    - If successful, the parsed DateTime is stored in an output parameter.
    - Example:
        string input = "08/29/2023";
        if (DateTime.TryParseExact(input, "MM/dd/yyyy", null, DateTimeStyles.None, out DateTime parsedDate))
        {
            "Parsing successful, use parsedDate"
        }

In summary:

- Parse: Simple parsing with the default or invariant culture, throws exceptions for failures.

- ParseExact: Parses with a specific format, throws exceptions for failures.

- TryParse: Attempts to parse, returns a boolean indicating success, and doesn't throw exceptions.

- TryParseExact: Attempts to parse with a specific format, returns a boolean indicating success, and doesn't throw exceptions.

For more control over parsing and better error handling, you generally want to use the TryParse and TryParseExact methods, 
especially when dealing with user input or data from external sources where the input might not be reliable.
