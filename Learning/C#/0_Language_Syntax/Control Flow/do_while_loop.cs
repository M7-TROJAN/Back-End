C# do...while loop
The do and while keyword is used to create a do...while loop. 
It is similar to a while loop, however there is a major difference between them.

In while loop, the condition is checked before the body is executed. 
It is the exact opposite in do...while loop, i.e. condition is checked after the body is executed.

This is why, the body of do...while loop will execute at least once irrespective to the test-expression.

The syntax for do...while loop is:

do
{
	body of do while loop

} while (test-expression);
