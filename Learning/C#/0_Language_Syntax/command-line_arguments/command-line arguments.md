# Passing Command-Line Arguments in C# Console Application

In C#, the `string[] args` parameter in the `Main` method of a console application is used to accept command-line arguments when the program is executed. When you run a C# console application from the command line, you can provide additional information to the program by passing arguments.

## Understanding `string[] args`

The `string[] args` parameter breakdown:
- **`string[]`**: Indicates that `args` is an array of strings, meaning it can hold multiple string values.
- **`args`**: Variable name for the array. Commonly used to store command-line arguments.

## Usage Example

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Check if any command-line arguments are provided
    if (args.Length > 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Command-line arguments:");

        // Print each command-line argument
        foreach (string arg in args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(arg);
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("No command-line arguments provided.");
    }
}
```
```bash
MyProgram.exe argument1 argument2
```

- In this case, `argument1` and `argument2` will be printed by the program.


## Setting Command-Line Arguments in Visual Studio

In Visual Studio, you can set command-line arguments for your C# console application through project settings. Here's how:

1. **Open Project Properties:**
   - Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select "Properties" from the context menu.

2. **Navigate to the Debug Tab:**
   - In the Project Designer, go to the "Debug" tab.

3. **Set Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Look for a field labeled "Command line arguments."
   - Enter your desired command-line arguments in this field.

4. **Save and Run:**
   - Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes.
   - Run your program (press `F5` or use the "Start Debugging" button).

Your program will now run with the specified command-line arguments as if you had provided them in the command prompt.

Remember that these settings are for debugging purposes within Visual Studio and do not affect how the application runs outside of the development environment. When you run your application outside of Visual Studio, you can still provide command-line arguments in the command prompt or terminal as you normally would.
