# DLL - Dynamic Link Library

**DLL** stands for **Dynamic Link Library**. A Dynamic Link Library is a file format used to store multiple functions that are compiled, executable, and reusable across different programs. DLL files contain code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously, which helps in efficient memory usage and code sharing.

## Key Characteristics of DLLs:

1. **Dynamic Linking:** DLLs allow dynamic linking, meaning that multiple programs can use the same DLL file at runtime. This promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

2. **Modularity:** DLLs promote modular programming by allowing developers to separate different parts of a program into distinct DLLs. This modular approach makes code maintenance and updates more manageable.

3. **Efficient Memory Usage:** Shared DLLs are loaded into memory only once, even if multiple programs use them. This can result in more efficient memory usage compared to static linking, where each program has its own copy of the code.

4. **Updates and Maintenance:** If a bug is fixed or an enhancement is made to a DLL, all programs using that DLL can benefit from the update without needing to recompile the programs.

DLLs are a fundamental concept in the Windows operating system and are widely used in software development to create more maintainable and modular applications.
