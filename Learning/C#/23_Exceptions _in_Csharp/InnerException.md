In C#, `InnerException` is a property of the `Exception` class that represents the exception that caused the current exception to occur. When an exception is thrown, it can sometimes be the result of another exception. In such cases, the original exception is stored within the `InnerException` property of the new exception.

This property is particularly useful in situations where an exception occurs as a consequence of another exception. By inspecting the `InnerException`, you can determine the root cause of the problem and handle it accordingly.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```csharp
try
{
    // Some code that might throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Check if the exception has an inner exception
    if (ex.InnerException != null)
    {
        // Handle the inner exception
        Console.WriteLine("Inner exception message: " + ex.InnerException.Message);
    }
    else
    {
        // Handle the exception without an inner exception
        Console.WriteLine("Exception message: " + ex.Message);
    }
}
```

In this example, if the caught exception (`ex`) has an inner exception, its message will be printed. Otherwise, the message of the caught exception itself will be printed. This allows you to provide more detailed error information to help diagnose and troubleshoot issues in your application.
