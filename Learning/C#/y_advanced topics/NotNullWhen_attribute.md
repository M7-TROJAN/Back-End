The `[NotNullWhen(true)]` attribute is a nullable annotation introduced in C# 8.0 to provide more precise information about the nullability of method parameters and return values. It's part of the nullable reference types feature, which helps developers write safer code by making nullability explicit and providing compile-time checks for null-related issues.

### Explanation of `[NotNullWhen(true)]`:

The `[NotNullWhen(true)]` attribute indicates that the method parameter `obj` will not be null when the method returns `true`. This attribute is typically used on boolean-returning methods to inform the caller about the nullability of the arguments based on the return value.

### Usage in `Equals` Method:

In the context of the `Equals` method:
```csharp
public override bool Equals([NotNullWhen(true)] object? obj);
```

This means that if the `Equals` method returns `true`, the `obj` parameter is guaranteed to be non-null. This provides additional information to the compiler and tools that perform static analysis, helping them understand the contract of the `Equals` method more precisely.

### Example:

Consider a typical implementation of the `Equals` method:
```csharp
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public override bool Equals([NotNullWhen(true)] object? obj)
    {
        if (obj is Person person)
        {
            return Name == person.Name;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public override int GetHashCode()
    {
        return Name.GetHashCode();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- If `obj` is not null and is of type `Person`, the method compares the `Name` property and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.
- If `obj` is null or not of type `Person`, the method returns `false`.

With `[NotNullWhen(true)]` applied:
- If `Equals` returns `true`, then `obj` must have been non-null and of type `Person`.

### Benefits:

1. **Improved Static Analysis**: Tools and the compiler can make better decisions about nullability, leading to more accurate warnings and errors regarding potential null reference exceptions.
2. **Documentation**: It serves as documentation for developers, indicating the conditions under which a parameter will be non-null.
3. **Enhanced Code Contracts**: Makes the method's behavior more explicit, which helps in understanding and maintaining the code.

### Summary:

- The `[NotNullWhen(true)]` attribute in the `Equals` method indicates that the parameter `obj` will not be null if the method returns `true`.
- This helps the compiler and static analysis tools understand the method's behavior better, leading to safer and more reliable code.
- It serves both as documentation and as a tool for enhanced static analysis, improving the overall quality of the codebase.
