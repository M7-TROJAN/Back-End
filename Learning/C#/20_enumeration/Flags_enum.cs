/*
In C#, the [Flags] attribute is used to indicate that an enum is intended to be used as bit flags, where each value represents a single bit. 
This attribute provides additional information to the compiler and developers, indicating that certain operations such as bitwise AND, OR, XOR, 
and NOT can be applied to the enum values.
