### LinkedList

**What is a LinkedList?**
A LinkedList is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in the sequence via a reference link. Unlike arrays, LinkedLists do not have a fixed size, and their elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

**Why LinkedList?**
LinkedLists offer dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays. They are especially useful when the number of elements is unknown, or when frequent insertions and deletions are required.

**LinkedListNode**
A LinkedListNode is an individual element within a LinkedList. Each node contains a reference to its data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

**Real-World Example of LinkedList**
Consider a playlist in a music player application. Each song in the playlist can be represented as a node in a LinkedList, with each node pointing to the next song in the playlist.

### HashSet

**What is a HashSet?**
A HashSet is a collection that stores unique elements without any particular order. It uses hashing to ensure fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. HashSet does not allow duplicate elements.

**Why HashSet?**
HashSet is useful when you need to maintain a collection of unique elements and require efficient operations for adding, removing, and checking for existence. It provides constant-time performance for these operations on average, making it suitable for large datasets.

### SortedList

**What is a SortedList?**
SortedList is a collection that maintains a sorted order of its elements based on the keys. Each element in a SortedList is a key-value pair. It provides efficient insertion, removal, and search operations with logarithmic time complexity.

**Comparison and Equality**
- **LinkedList vs. ArrayList**: LinkedList provides faster insertions and deletions but slower random access compared to ArrayList.
- **HashSet vs. TreeSet**: HashSet provides faster operations but does not maintain the elements in any particular order, while TreeSet maintains elements in sorted order.
- **HashSet vs. LinkedHashSet**: HashSet offers faster operations but does not maintain the insertion order, while LinkedHashSet maintains the insertion order of elements.
- **HashSet vs. HashMap**: HashSet stores only keys without values, while HashMap stores key-value pairs.
- **HashSet vs. HashTable**: HashSet is not synchronized and allows null elements, while HashTable is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values.

Understanding these data structures and their characteristics will enable you to choose the most appropriate one for your specific use case. Happy learning!
