`List` and `ArrayList` are both collection classes in C#, but they have different characteristics and behaviors.

1. **List**:
   - `List<T>` is a generic collection class introduced in .NET Framework 2.0.
   - It is part of the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace.
   - It stores elements of a specific type `T` in a dynamic array, providing type safety and performance benefits.
   - `List<T>` automatically resizes itself as needed when elements are added or removed.
   - It provides methods like `Add`, `Remove`, `Contains`, and properties like `Count` for common list operations.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
     numbers.Add(1);
     numbers.Add(2);
     ```

2. **ArrayList**:
   - `ArrayList` is a non-generic collection class introduced in .NET Framework 1.0.
   - It is part of the `System.Collections` namespace.
   - It stores elements of type `object`, allowing it to hold elements of any type.
   - Since `ArrayList` stores objects, it requires boxing and unboxing operations when dealing with value types, which can impact performance.
   - `ArrayList` does not provide type safety at compile time; type safety is enforced at runtime.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
     list.Add(1); // Boxing operation for int
     list.Add("Hello");
     ```

`List<T>` is preferred over `ArrayList` in most scenarios because it offers type safety, better performance, and is easier to use due to its generic nature. However, `ArrayList` may still be used in legacy code or situations where compatibility with older versions of .NET is required.
