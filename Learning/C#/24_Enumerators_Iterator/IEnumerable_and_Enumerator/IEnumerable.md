In C#, `IEnumerable` is an interface defined in the `System.Collections` namespace. It represents a collection of objects that can be enumerated, allowing you to iterate over its elements sequentially. This interface defines a single method:

```csharp
IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
```

The `GetEnumerator` method returns an `IEnumerator` object, which provides the ability to iterate over the collection by sequentially accessing its elements one by one.

When you implement the `IEnumerable` interface in your custom collection class, you're essentially enabling the ability to iterate over the elements of that collection using constructs like `foreach` loops in C#. 

Here's a brief overview of how `IEnumerable` works:

1. **Implementing `IEnumerable`**: To enable iteration over your custom collection, you implement the `IEnumerable` interface in your class.

2. **GetEnumerator Method**: In the implementation of `IEnumerable`, you provide a `GetEnumerator` method. This method returns an `IEnumerator` object that knows how to traverse the collection.

3. **IEnumerator Interface**: The `IEnumerator` interface, which is also part of the collections framework, provides methods like `MoveNext()`, `Reset()`, and a property `Current` to access the current element in the iteration.

4. **Foreach Loop**: Once your class implements `IEnumerable`, you can use a `foreach` loop to iterate over the elements of your collection. Behind the scenes, the compiler uses the `GetEnumerator` method to obtain an enumerator and iterates over the elements using the methods provided by `IEnumerator`.

In summary, `IEnumerable` is a fundamental interface in C# for enabling iteration over collections, providing a standardized way to work with sequences of elements in a loop or through LINQ operations.
