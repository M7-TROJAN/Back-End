`IComparable` is  interface that is used for comparing objects of a particular type. It's typically used when you want to define a default sort order for instances of your custom class or when you need to perform comparisons between instances of the same type.

overview of `IComparable`:

1. **Interface Definition**: `IComparable` is defined in the `System` namespace as follows:

    ```csharp
    public interface IComparable
    {
        int CompareTo(object? obj);
    }
    ```

    This interface defines a single method, `CompareTo`, which takes an object parameter and returns an integer indicating the relative order of the current instance compared to the specified object. The method returns:

    - A negative integer if the current instance precedes the specified object.
    - Zero if the current instance is equal to the specified object.
    - A positive integer if the current instance follows the specified object.

2. **Implementing `IComparable`**: To enable comparisons between instances of your custom class, you implement the `IComparable` interface in your class and provide the implementation for the `CompareTo` method. Inside this method, you define the logic for comparing the current instance with another object of the same type.

3. **Usage**: Once `IComparable` is implemented, you can use methods that rely on comparisons, such as sorting algorithms (`Array.Sort`, LINQ's `OrderBy`, `OrderByDescending`, etc.), to sort collections of your custom objects based on the defined comparison logic.

Here's an example of implementing `IComparable`:

```csharp
public class Person : IComparable<Person>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public int CompareTo(Person other)
    {
        // Compare based on age
        return this.Age.CompareTo(other.Age);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Person` class implements `IComparable<Person>`, indicating that it can be compared to other `Person` objects. The `CompareTo` method compares instances based on their age. This allows instances of `Person` to be sorted by age using sorting methods that rely on `IComparable`, such as `Array.Sort` or LINQ's sorting methods.
