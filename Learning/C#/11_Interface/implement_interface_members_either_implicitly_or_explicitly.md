In C#, you can implement interface members either implicitly or explicitly. Both methods have their use cases and can affect how the interface members are accessed. Here’s a detailed explanation of the differences and when you might use each method.

### Implicit Interface Implementation

When you implement an interface implicitly, the interface members are implemented as public members of the class. This means they can be accessed through an instance of the class directly.

**Example:**

```csharp
class Person : IComparable<Person>
{
    // Implicit implementation
    public int CompareTo(Person? other)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

// Usage
Person person1 = new Person();
Person person2 = new Person();
int result = person1.CompareTo(person2); // Directly accessible
```

**Characteristics:**
- The method is part of the class's public interface.
- The method can be accessed using a class instance.
- More straightforward and typically used when you want the interface members to be part of the class's public API.

### Explicit Interface Implementation

When you implement an interface explicitly, the interface members are not accessible directly through the class instances. Instead, they are only accessible through an interface reference.

**Example:**

```csharp
class Person : IComparable<Person>
{
    // Explicit implementation
    int IComparable<Person>.CompareTo(Person? other)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}

// Usage
Person person1 = new Person();
Person person2 = new Person();
IComparable<Person> comparable = person1; // Cast to interface
int result = comparable.CompareTo(person2); // Accessible through interface reference
```

**Characteristics:**
- The method is not part of the class's public interface and cannot be accessed directly from the class instance.
- The method can only be accessed through an instance of the interface.
- Useful when you want to avoid polluting the class's public API with interface-specific members, or when there is a name conflict between interface members and class members.

### Comparison and When to Use Each

1. **Access Control:**
   - **Implicit:** Makes the interface method part of the class's public API, directly accessible.
   - **Explicit:** Restricts access to the method via an interface reference, not directly accessible from the class instance.

2. **Name Conflicts:**
   - **Implicit:** Can lead to name conflicts if the class already has a member with the same name.
   - **Explicit:** Avoids name conflicts as the member is only accessible through the interface.

3. **Public API Design:**
   - **Implicit:** Use when you want the interface methods to be a part of the class’s public API.
   - **Explicit:** Use when you want to hide the interface methods from the class’s public API and only expose them through the interface.

4. **Interface-Specific Logic:**
   - **Implicit:** Suitable for simple cases where the interface implementation is straightforward and should be exposed.
   - **Explicit:** Suitable for complex cases where the interface method is not intended to be used directly or where multiple interfaces with conflicting method names are implemented.

### Example with Both Implementations

```csharp
using System;

interface IDisplay
{
    void Display();
}

interface IPrint
{
    void Display();
}

class Document : IDisplay, IPrint
{
    // Implicit implementation for IDisplay
    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Display from IDisplay");
    }

    // Explicit implementation for IPrint
    void IPrint.Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Display from IPrint");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.Display(); // Calls IDisplay.Display()

        IPrint printable = doc;
        printable.Display(); // Calls IPrint.Display()
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `Display` method from `IDisplay` is implemented implicitly and can be called directly from the `Document` instance.
- `Display` method from `IPrint` is implemented explicitly and can only be called through an `IPrint` interface reference.

### Conclusion

The choice between implicit and explicit interface implementation depends on how you want the interface members to be exposed and accessed. Use implicit implementation for simplicity and direct access, and explicit implementation to avoid name conflicts and hide interface members from the class’s public API.
