In C# 9.0, the `record` keyword introduces a new type of reference type called a record type. Records are immutable by default and are primarily used to store data in a more concise and readable manner, particularly for classes that are used primarily to store data and don't contain much behavior.

Here's a summary of the key features of records in C#:

1. **Immutable by Default**: Record types are immutable by default, meaning once they are created, their properties cannot be modified.

2. **Value Equality**: Records provide value-based equality by default. Two instances of the same record type with the same property values are considered equal.

3. **With-expressions**: Records provide a `with` expression syntax, allowing you to create a new record instance with modified property values while keeping the rest of the properties unchanged.

4. **ToString Method**: Records automatically override the `ToString` method to provide a human-readable string representation of the record's properties.

5. **Deconstruct Method**: Records provide a deconstructor (`Deconstruct` method) to easily deconstruct the record into its individual properties.

a simple example demonstrating the use of the `record` keyword:

```csharp
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age);

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Creating a new Person record
        Person person1 = new Person("Mahmoud", "Mattar", 24);
        Person person2 = new Person("Mahmoud", "Mattar", 24);

        // Value-based equality comparison
        Console.WriteLine($"Are person1 and person2 equal? {person1 == person2}"); // Output: True

        // With-expression to create a new record with modified property
        Person modifiedPerson = person1 with { Age = 35 };
        Console.WriteLine(modifiedPerson); // Output: Person { FirstName = Mahmoud, LastName = Mattar, Age = 35 }

        // Deconstructing the record
        var (firstName, lastName, age) = person1;
        Console.WriteLine($"First Name: {firstName}, Last Name: {lastName}, Age: {age}"); // Output: First Name: Mahmoud, Last Name: Mattar, Age: 30

        // if you try to modify a property of a record, you will get a compile-time error
        // modifiedPerson.Age = 30; // Error: Property or indexer 'Person.Age' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
    }
}
```

In summary, records in C# provide a concise and immutable way to represent data, making them particularly useful for DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), model classes, and other scenarios where immutability and value-based equality are desired.
