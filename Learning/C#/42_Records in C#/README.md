### Records in C#

#### C# 9.0 (Reference Types)
Records in C# 9.0 are reference types, designed to be immutable and provide built-in features for value-based equality.

**Example:**
```csharp
record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);

var person1 = new Person("John", "Doe");
var person2 = new Person("John", "Doe");

Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2); // True
```
Here, `person1` and `person2` are considered equal because records implement value-based equality.

#### C# 10.0 (Value Types)
C# 10.0 introduced `record struct`, which is a value type. This provides the same benefits as records but with value-type semantics.

**Example:**
```csharp
record struct Point(int X, int Y);

var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
var point2 = new Point(1, 2);

Console.WriteLine(point1 == point2); // True
```
In this case, `point1` and `point2` are considered equal because they have the same values.

### Immutability and Records

Immutability means the state of an object cannot be changed after it is created. Records are designed to be immutable by default.

**Example:**
```csharp
record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);

var person = new Person("John", "Doe");

// Attempting to modify the properties will result in a compilation error
// person.FirstName = "Jane"; // Error
```

### Value-Based Equality vs Reference-Based Equality

#### Value-Based Equality

Value-based equality means two objects are considered equal if their values are equal. Records by default implement value-based equality.

**Example:**
```csharp
record Point(int X, int Y);

var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
var point2 = new Point(1, 2);

Console.WriteLine(point1 == point2); // True
```

#### Reference-Based Equality

Reference-based equality means two objects are considered equal if they reference the same memory location. This is the default for classes.

**Example:**
```csharp
class Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}

var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
var point2 = new Point(1, 2);

Console.WriteLine(point1 == point2); // False
```

### Object HashCode

A hash code is used to identify objects in collections like dictionaries. Overriding `GetHashCode` ensures that objects can be used effectively in hash-based collections.

#### Bad Implementation
```csharp
class Point : IEquatable<Point>
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public bool Equals(Point? other)
    {
        if (other is null) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
        return X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => Equals(obj as Point);

    public override int GetHashCode() => X.GetHashCode() ^ Y.GetHashCode();
}
```

This implementation is bad because using XOR can result in the same hash code for different values. 

#### Better Implementation
```csharp
class BetterPoint : IEquatable<BetterPoint>
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public bool Equals(BetterPoint? other)
    {
        if (other is null) return false;
        if (ReferenceEquals(this, other)) return true;
        return X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
    }

    public override bool Equals(object? obj) => Equals(obj as BetterPoint);

    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(X, Y);
}
```

Using `HashCode.Combine` provides a more reliable way to generate hash codes.

#### Dictionary Example
```csharp
var p1 = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };
var p2 = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };

Dictionary<Point, string> dict = new Dictionary<Point, string>();

dict.Add(p1, "First Point");
dict.Add(p2, "Second Point");

foreach (var item in dict)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Key: {item.Key.X}, {item.Key.Y} Value: {item.Value}");
}
```

Without properly overriding `GetHashCode`, the dictionary will treat `p1` and `p2` as different keys, allowing both to be added. With `HashCode.Combine`, adding the second point will throw an exception because it considers `p1` and `p2` to have the same key.

### Instantiating and `init` Keyword

#### Instantiating
Instantiating means creating a new instance of a class or a struct.

**Example:**
```csharp
var point = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };
```

#### `init` Keyword
The `init` keyword allows setting properties only during object creation, making them immutable thereafter.

**Example:**
```csharp
class Point
{
    public int X { get; init; }
    public int Y { get; init; }
}

var point = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };
// point.X = 3; // Error
```

### Records with Examples

#### Record with Positional Syntax
```csharp
record Point(int X, int Y);

var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
var point2 = new Point(1, 2);

Console.WriteLine(point1 == point2); // True
```

#### Deconstructing Records
```csharp
var point = new Point(1, 2);
var (x, y) = point; // Deconstructing

Console.WriteLine($"x: {x}, y: {y}"); // x: 1, y: 2
```

#### Using Object Initializer with Records
```csharp
record Point(int X, int Y)
{
    public Point() : this(0, 0) { }
}

var point = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };
```

### Record Structs in C# 10.0

#### Example of Record Struct
```csharp
public record struct Point(int X, int Y);

var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine(point1);

var point2 = point1 with { X = 4 }; // `with` expression
Console.WriteLine(point2);
```

### `with` Expression
The `with` expression creates a new object that is a copy of an existing object with some properties modified.

**Example:**
```csharp
var p1 = new Point(1, 2);
Console.WriteLine(p1);

var p2 = p1 with { X = 4 };
Console.WriteLine(p2);
```

### Summary

- **Records** in C# 9.0 and later provide built-in immutability and value-based equality.
- **Immutability** ensures an object's state cannot change after creation.
- **Value-Based Equality** checks if two objects have the same values, while **Reference-Based Equality** checks if they reference the same memory location.
- **Hash Codes** are crucial for identifying objects in collections like dictionaries. Using `HashCode.Combine` is a better approach for generating reliable hash codes.
- **Instantiating Objects** creates new instances, and the **`init` keyword** makes properties immutable after object creation.
- **Record structs** in C# 10.0 offer value type semantics with record benefits.
- The **`with` expression** allows creating modified copies of objects.
