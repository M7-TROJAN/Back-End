### Understanding Global Query Filters and the `HasQueryFilter` Method in EF Core

#### 1. **Introduction to Global Query Filters**

A **Global Query Filter** in EF Core is a filter that is applied automatically to all queries for a particular entity type. This filter is defined at the model configuration level and is useful for scenarios where you want to enforce a condition across the entire application, such as soft deletes, multi-tenancy, or filtering out outdated records.

Global Query Filters are specified using the `HasQueryFilter` method in the `OnModelCreating` method within the DbContext class.

#### 2. **Purpose and Benefits**

- **Consistency**: The filter is applied consistently across all queries, so you don't have to remember to include it in each query.
- **Security**: Helps in preventing accidental exposure of sensitive data by ensuring certain conditions are always met.
- **Maintainability**: Reduces code duplication by centralizing common filtering logic.

#### 3. **Example: Applying a Global Query Filter**

Let’s consider a scenario where you have a `Section` table and you want to filter out all sections that started more than two years ago. 

##### **Entity Class:**
```csharp
public class Section
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string SectionName { get; set; }
    public DateRange DateRange { get; set; }
    public TimeSlot TimeSlot { get; set; }
    // Other properties...
}
```

##### **Global Query Filter Configuration:**
```csharp
public class SectionConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Section>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Section> builder)
    {
        var twoYearsDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddYears(-2));
        builder.HasQueryFilter(x => x.DateRange.StartDate >= twoYearsDate);
    }
}
```

##### **Using the Filter in Context:**
```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    foreach (var section in context.Sections)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{section.Id}\t{section.SectionName}\t{section.DateRange}\t{section.TimeSlot}");
    }
}
```

In this example, the filter ensures that only sections starting within the last two years are retrieved. 

#### **SQL Query Generated:**
When you execute the query, EF Core automatically includes the filter condition:

```sql
SELECT [s].[Id], [s].[CourseId], [s].[InstructorId], [s].[ScheduleId], [s].[SectionName], 
       [s].[EndDate], [s].[StartDate], [s].[EndTime], [s].[StartTime]
FROM [Sections] AS [s]
WHERE [s].[StartDate] >= '2022-08-13'
```

#### 4. **Disabling Global Query Filters**

Sometimes, you might want to disable a global query filter for specific queries. You can do this using the `IgnoreQueryFilters()` method:

```csharp
var allSections = context.Sections.IgnoreQueryFilters().ToList();
```

This will bypass the global filter and return all `Section` entities, regardless of the start date.

#### 5. **Multiple Global Query Filters**

You can apply multiple global query filters to an entity. EF Core combines these filters using the `AND` operator. For example:

```csharp
builder.HasQueryFilter(x => x.DateRange.StartDate >= twoYearsDate && x.IsActive);
```

#### 6. **Limitations and Considerations**

- **Complexity**: Overusing global query filters can make the debugging process more complex because the filters are not immediately visible in the query code.
- **Performance**: Depending on the complexity of the filter, there could be performance implications, especially if the filter involves multiple joins or subqueries.
- **Careful Planning**: It’s essential to plan and document global filters thoroughly to ensure they don't interfere with other parts of your application.

#### 7. **Best Practices**

- **Centralize Filters**: Use global query filters for conditions that are truly global and applicable across the entire application.
- **Document Filters**: Clearly document any global query filters in your codebase, so developers are aware of the filters being applied.
- **Combine with `IgnoreQueryFilters()`**: Where necessary, combine global query filters with `IgnoreQueryFilters()` for queries that need to bypass the filters.

#### 8. **Conclusion**

Global Query Filters in EF Core provide a powerful mechanism to enforce global conditions on your entity queries. They enhance consistency and security, but they must be used judiciously to avoid unintended side effects. The `HasQueryFilter` method simplifies the process of defining these filters, making it easier to maintain consistent query behavior across your application.

# Global Query Filters in Entity Framework Core

## Introduction
Global Query Filters are a powerful feature in EF Core that allows you to apply a filter to all queries for a specific entity type, ensuring consistent data retrieval across the entire application.

## Purpose
Global Query Filters are used to:
- Apply common conditions across all queries.
- Enhance security by limiting data exposure.
- Simplify code by centralizing filtering logic.

## Example
### Entity Class
```csharp
public class Section
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string SectionName { get; set; }
    public DateRange DateRange { get; set; }
    public TimeSlot TimeSlot { get; set; }
}
```

### Applying a Global Query Filter
```csharp
public class SectionConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Section>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Section> builder)
    {
        var twoYearsDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now.AddYears(-2));
        builder.HasQueryFilter(x => x.DateRange.StartDate >= twoYearsDate);
    }
}
```

### SQL Query Generated
```sql
SELECT [s].[Id], [s].[CourseId], [s].[InstructorId], [s].[ScheduleId], [s].[SectionName], 
       [s].[EndDate], [s].[StartDate], [s].[EndTime], [s].[StartTime]
FROM [Sections] AS [s]
WHERE [s].[StartDate] >= '2022-08-13'
```

## Disabling Global Query Filters
```csharp
var allSections = context.Sections.IgnoreQueryFilters().ToList();
```

## Best Practices
- **Centralize Filters**: Use for truly global conditions.
- **Document Filters**: Ensure visibility to other developers.
- **Combine with `IgnoreQueryFilters()`**: For exceptions.

## Conclusion
Global Query Filters are a useful tool for maintaining consistent query logic across your application, but they should be used thoughtfully to avoid complexity and performance issues.
