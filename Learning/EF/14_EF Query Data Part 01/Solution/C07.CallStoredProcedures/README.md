To call a stored procedure in Entity Framework (EF) Core, you can use the `FromSqlRaw` or `FromSqlInterpolated` methods if you're working with a model that maps the results of the stored procedure. Here's how you can call the `sp_GetSectionDetails` stored procedure in EF Core:

### 1. **Create a Class to Hold the Result**
   First, you need to create a class that will map the result of the stored procedure.

   ```csharp
   public class SectionDetailsDto
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public string CourseName { get; set; }
       public int TotalHours { get; set; }
       public string SectionName { get; set; }
       public string Instructor { get; set; }
       public string Period { get; set; }
       public string Timeslot { get; set; }
       public bool SUN { get; set; }
       public bool MON { get; set; }
       public bool Tue { get; set; }
       public bool WED { get; set; }
       public bool THU { get; set; }
       public bool FRI { get; set; }
       public bool SAT { get; set; }
       public int HoursPerWeek { get; set; }
   }
   ```

### 2. **Call the Stored Procedure**
   You can use `FromSqlRaw` to call the stored procedure. Here's an example:

   ```csharp
   using (var context = new AppDbContext())
   {
       int sectionId = 1; // Example section ID
       var sectionDetails = context.Set<SectionDetailsDto>()
           .FromSqlRaw("EXEC sp_GetSectionDetails @SectionId", new SqlParameter("@SectionId", sectionId))
           .AsNoTracking()
           .ToList();

       foreach (var detail in sectionDetails)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Section: {detail.SectionName}, Instructor: {detail.Instructor}, Period: {detail.Period}");
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Use `FromSqlInterpolated` for More Safety**
   If you prefer to use string interpolation (which is safer as it handles SQL injection), you can do so with `FromSqlInterpolated`:

   ```csharp
   using (var context = new AppDbContext())
   {
       int sectionId = 1; // Example section ID
       var sectionDetails = context.Set<SectionDetailsDto>()
           .FromSqlInterpolated($"EXEC sp_GetSectionDetails @SectionId = {sectionId}")
           .AsNoTracking()
           .ToList();

       foreach (var detail in sectionDetails)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Section: {detail.SectionName}, Instructor: {detail.Instructor}, Period: {detail.Period}");
       }
   }
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`SectionDetailsDto`**: A data transfer object (DTO) that maps the result of the stored procedure.
- **`FromSqlRaw`**: Executes a raw SQL query against the database and returns the results as entities of the specified type.
- **`FromSqlInterpolated`**: Similar to `FromSqlRaw` but uses string interpolation, which helps prevent SQL injection.
- **`SqlParameter`**: Used to pass parameters to the stored procedure.

### Important Notes:
- Make sure the properties in `SectionDetailsDto` match the names and types of the columns returned by your stored procedure.
- The `AsNoTracking()` method is used to ensure that the entities are not tracked by the context, which can improve performance if you don't need to update them.


## 

Using stored procedures in Entity Framework (EF) Core can be useful for various scenarios, such as:
1. **Complex Queries:** When the query logic is too complex to be easily expressed with LINQ.
2. **Performance:** When you want to leverage the database server's processing power for certain operations.
3. **Encapsulation:** To encapsulate business logic in the database.

However, whether using stored procedures is the best practice in EF Core depends on your specific use case. Here are some considerations:

### When to Use Stored Procedures:
- **Complex Business Logic:** When the logic is best encapsulated and executed on the database side.
- **Performance Optimizations:** For operations that are faster when run as stored procedures due to database optimizations.
- **Legacy Systems:** When working with a legacy database that already has stored procedures in place.

### Best Practices for Using Stored Procedures in EF Core:
1. **Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**
   - Create DTOs that map to the result set of your stored procedure. This avoids the need to map the results to your entity classes directly, which might not align well.

2. **Use `FromSqlInterpolated` for Safety:**
   - `FromSqlInterpolated` should be preferred over `FromSqlRaw` when dealing with dynamic input to prevent SQL injection.

3. **Use `AsNoTracking` for Read-Only Data:**
   - If you are retrieving data that won't be modified, use `AsNoTracking()` to improve performance by avoiding change tracking.

4. **Encapsulate the Logic:**
   - Encapsulate the logic for calling the stored procedure within a repository or service class. This keeps your DbContext clean and makes the code easier to maintain.

5. **Avoid Overuse:**
   - EF Core is designed to work well with LINQ and its strong type safety, compile-time checking, and ease of use. Use stored procedures only when necessary.

6. **Leverage EF Core’s Native Features:**
   - For simple CRUD operations, prefer EF Core's built-in methods over stored procedures to keep your codebase more consistent and maintainable.

### Example of Encapsulating Stored Procedure Call:
Encapsulating the stored procedure call in a service or repository class:

```csharp
public class SectionRepository
{
    private readonly AppDbContext _context;

    public SectionRepository(AppDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public List<SectionDetailsDto> GetSectionDetails(int sectionId)
    {
        return _context.Set<SectionDetailsDto>()
            .FromSqlInterpolated($"EXEC sp_GetSectionDetails @SectionId = {sectionId}")
            .AsNoTracking()
            .ToList();
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
var sectionRepo = new SectionRepository(context);
var details = sectionRepo.GetSectionDetails(1);

foreach (var detail in details)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Section: {detail.SectionName}, Instructor: {detail.Instructor}, Period: {detail.Period}");
}
```

### When to Avoid Stored Procedures:
- **Simple Queries:** Prefer LINQ and EF Core's native methods for straightforward queries.
- **Maintainability:** If stored procedures make your application harder to maintain, consider alternative approaches.
- **Testability:** EF Core's LINQ-based queries are easier to unit test compared to stored procedures.

### Conclusion:
Using stored procedures in EF Core can be a best practice in certain scenarios, particularly when you need to perform complex operations or leverage existing database logic. However, for most CRUD operations and simpler queries, EF Core’s LINQ-based approach is typically preferred for its maintainability and ease of use. Always weigh the pros and cons based on your specific application needs.
