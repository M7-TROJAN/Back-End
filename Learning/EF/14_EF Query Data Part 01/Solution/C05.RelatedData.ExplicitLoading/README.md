### Understanding `RelatedData.ExplicitLoading` in EF Core

In Entity Framework Core, explicit loading is a technique where you manually load related data from the database. Unlike eager loading (where related data is loaded as part of the initial query) or lazy loading (where related data is loaded automatically when it's accessed), explicit loading gives you precise control over when and how related data is fetched.

Explicit loading is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to defer the loading of related data until you actually need it or when you want to load related data conditionally based on some logic.

### How Explicit Loading Works

Explicit loading is done using the `DbContext.Entry` method, which provides access to information about a particular entity's state and its related data. You can use the `Collection` or `Reference` methods to load related collections or single entities.

Here are the key methods used in explicit loading:

1. **`Collection()` Method**: This method is used to load a collection of related entities. For example, if you want to load all participants of a specific section, you would use this method.

2. **`Reference()` Method**: This method is used to load a single related entity. For example, if you want to load the instructor of a specific section, you would use this method.

3. **`Query()` Method**: This method allows you to filter or customize the query before executing it. This is useful if you only want to load a subset of related data based on certain conditions.

### Example 1: Loading a Collection of Related Data

Let's say you have a `Section` entity and you want to explicitly load all the participants of a specific section.

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var sectionId = 1;

    // Load the section
    var section = context.Sections.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == sectionId);

    // Explicitly load the Participants collection for the section
    var query = context.Entry(section).Collection(x => x.Participants).Query();

    Console.WriteLine($"Section: {section.SectionName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"--------------------");

    foreach (var participant in query)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{participant.Id}] {participant.FName} {participant.LName}");
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `context.Entry(section).Collection(x => x.Participants).Query()` line creates a query that will load the participants for the given section. 
- This query can be further customized with additional `Where`, `OrderBy`, or other LINQ methods if needed.

### Example 2: Loading a Single Related Entity

If you want to explicitly load a related entity like `Instructor`, you can use the `Reference` method:

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var sectionId = 1;

    // Load the section
    var section = context.Sections.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == sectionId);

    // Explicitly load the Instructor reference for the section
    context.Entry(section).Reference(x => x.Instructor).Load();

    Console.WriteLine($"Section: {section.SectionName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Instructor: {section.Instructor?.FName} {section.Instructor?.LName}");
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `context.Entry(section).Reference(x => x.Instructor).Load()` line explicitly loads the `Instructor` entity associated with the given `Section`.
- The `Load()` method is directly called here because it doesn't involve any complex filtering.


### Example 3: The `Query()` Method

### The `Query()` Method

The `Query()` method is used when you want to filter or customize the related data before it is loaded. This is particularly useful if you need to load only a subset of related data based on specific conditions.

### Example Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we have a `Section` and we only want to load participants who are interns. Here's how you can do that using the `Query()` method.

#### Sample Classes

```csharp
public class Section : Entity
{
    public string? SectionName { get; set; }
    public int CourseId { get; set; }
    public Course? Course { get; set; }
    public int InstructorId { get; set; }
    public Instructor? Instructor { get; set; }
    public int ScheduleId { get; set; }
    public Schedule? Schedule { get; set; }
    public DateRange DateRange { get; set; } = new();
    public TimeSlot TimeSlot { get; set; } = new();
    public List<Participant> Participants { get; set; } = new List<Participant>();
}

public class Participant : Entity
{
    public string FName { get; set; }
    public string LName { get; set; }
    public bool IsIntern { get; set; }  // Indicates whether the participant is an intern
}
```

#### Example Code

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    // Load a specific section
    var sectionId = 1;
    var section = context.Sections.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == sectionId);

    if (section != null)
    {
        // Explicitly load only interns from the Participants collection
        var internsQuery = context.Entry(section)
                                   .Collection(x => x.Participants)
                                   .Query()
                                   .Where(p => p.IsIntern);

        var interns = internsQuery.ToList();

        Console.WriteLine($"Section: {section.SectionName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Intern Participants:");
        foreach (var intern in interns)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[{intern.Id}] {intern.FName} {intern.LName}");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Loading the Section**: We first load a specific `Section` entity using `FirstOrDefault`.
2. **Using `Query()` Method**: We then use the `Query()` method to filter the `Participants` collection to only include those who are interns.
3. **Customizing the Query**: The `Where(p => p.IsIntern)` condition is applied to filter the participants.
4. **Executing the Query**: Finally, we execute the query and load only the filtered participants (interns) into memory.

### Why Use `Query()`?

The `Query()` method is particularly useful when:
- You only need a subset of related data.
- You want to avoid loading unnecessary data, thus optimizing performance.
- You need to apply specific conditions or transformations to the related data before loading it.


### Benefits of Using `Query()` with Explicit Loading

- **Efficiency**: By loading only the data you need, you reduce the amount of data transferred from the database, which can improve performance.
- **Flexibility**: You can apply complex filtering or sorting logic before loading the related data, giving you more control over what gets loaded.
- **Lazy Execution**: The `Query()` method allows you to define the query but execute it later, giving you the flexibility to decide when to actually retrieve the data.

### Conclusion

The `Query()` method within `Explicit Loading` allows you to have granular control over the related data you load. This can lead to more efficient queries and better performance in your applications.

This example should help clarify how to use the `Query()` method in `Explicit Loading` scenarios.


### When to Use Explicit Loading

- **Performance Considerations**: If you have a scenario where loading related data eagerly would bring in a lot of unnecessary data, explicit loading is more efficient.
- **Conditional Loading**: If you only want to load related data based on certain conditions, explicit loading gives you the control to do so.
- **Avoiding Lazy Loading**: If you have lazy loading disabled or want to avoid the potential performance pitfalls of lazy loading, explicit loading is a good alternative.

### Important Points

- **Avoid Overusing**: While explicit loading gives you fine control, overusing it can lead to multiple database round-trips, which might affect performance. Always consider if eager loading or lazy loading might be more appropriate.
- **Handling `null` Values**: If the related entity or collection doesn't exist, the related property will be `null` or an empty collection, so always check for `null` before accessing the related data.

By understanding and using explicit loading appropriately, you can have fine-grained control over how related data is fetched, optimizing both the performance and behavior of your application.
