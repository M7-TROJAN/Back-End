### Understanding `SplitQueries` in Entity Framework Core

**`SplitQueries`** is a feature in Entity Framework (EF) Core that allows you to split a single query into multiple queries when you are loading related data using the `Include` method. This can help mitigate performance issues that arise when fetching large amounts of related data, particularly when there is a risk of a **Cartesian explosion**.

#### **What is a Cartesian Explosion?**
A **Cartesian explosion** occurs when you perform a join between two tables with a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of rows returned. This happens because for each record in the parent table, all matching records in the child table are returned, leading to duplicated rows and an inflated result set.

For example, if a `Course` has multiple `Sections` and each `Section` has multiple `Reviews`, joining these tables together without proper filtering can result in a large number of rows being returned, many of which may contain redundant or duplicated data.

#### **Purpose of `SplitQueries`**
The purpose of `SplitQueries` is to avoid such performance pitfalls by splitting the query into multiple, smaller queries, each responsible for loading a specific part of the data. This reduces the likelihood of a Cartesian explosion and can improve the overall performance of your application.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Proper Projection to Avoid Cartesian Explosion**
In this example, we use projection to select only the necessary fields, which reduces the amount of data retrieved and minimizes the risk of performance issues.

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var coursesProjection = context.Courses.AsNoTracking()
        .Select(c => new
        {
            CourseId = c.Id,
            CourseName = c.CourseName,
            Hours = c.HoursToComplete,
            Section = c.Sections.Select(s => new
            {
                SectionId = s.Id,
                SectionName = s.SectionName,
                DateRate = s.DateRange.ToString(),
                TimeSlot = s.TimeSlot.ToString()
            }),
            Reviews = c.Reviews.Select(r => new
            {
                FeedBack = r.Feedback,
                CreateAt = r.CreatedAt
            })
        }).ToList();
}
```
Here, we are using a proper projection to avoid retrieving unnecessary data. This helps in reducing network traffic and improves the applicationâ€™s performance.

#### **Example 2: Explicit `AsSplitQuery`**
In this example, we explicitly use `AsSplitQuery` to tell EF Core to split the query into multiple smaller queries.

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var courses1 = context.Courses
        .Include(x => x.Sections)
        .Include(x => x.Reviews)
        .AsSplitQuery() // explicit
        .ToList();
}   
```
By using `AsSplitQuery()`, the related data (i.e., `Sections` and `Reviews`) is loaded through separate queries, preventing the Cartesian explosion that could occur if all the data were loaded in a single query.

#### **Example 3: Configuring Default Query Splitting Behavior**
You can configure the default query splitting behavior using `UseQuerySplittingBehavior` in the `OnConfiguring` method.

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    var connectionString = "YourConnectionStringHere";
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString,
        o => o.UseQuerySplittingBehavior(QuerySplittingBehavior.SplitQuery))
        .LogTo(Console.WriteLine, Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel.Information);
}
```
With this configuration, EF Core will split queries by default whenever you include related data.

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var courses2 = context.Courses
      .Include(x => x.Sections)
      .Include(x => x.Reviews) // split by config
      .ToList();
}
```

#### **Example 4: Bypassing Split Query Behavior**
You can override the default query splitting behavior and force EF Core to execute the query as a single query using `AsSingleQuery()`.

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    var courses3 = context.Courses
    .Include(x => x.Sections)
    .Include(x => x.Reviews) // split by config
    .AsSingleQuery() // override split query behavior
    .ToList();
}
```
In this example, `AsSingleQuery()` forces EF Core to load the related data in one single query, which might be useful in scenarios where you know the query will return a manageable amount of data.

### **Advantages and Disadvantages of `SplitQueries`**

#### **Advantages:**
1. **Prevents Cartesian Explosion:** By splitting queries, you avoid the exponential increase in rows that can occur with joins on large datasets.
2. **Improved Performance:** Smaller queries reduce the load on the database and network, improving the performance of your application.
3. **Reduced Memory Usage:** Since each query retrieves a smaller subset of data, memory usage is more efficient.

#### **Disadvantages:**
1. **Multiple Database Round-Trips:** Splitting a query into multiple queries can result in multiple round-trips to the database, which may increase latency.
2. **Complexity:** Managing and configuring split queries can add complexity to your codebase, especially if you need to override default behaviors frequently.
3. **Potential for Data Inconsistency:** If the data changes between queries (e.g., inserts, updates), you may retrieve inconsistent data across the different queries.

### **Conclusion**
`SplitQueries` is a powerful feature in EF Core that helps manage the complexity of loading related data, especially in scenarios where there is a risk of a Cartesian explosion. By understanding when and how to use it, you can significantly improve the performance and reliability of your application. However, it's important to balance the advantages with the potential disadvantages, particularly in terms of increased database round-trips and the added complexity of managing split queries.
