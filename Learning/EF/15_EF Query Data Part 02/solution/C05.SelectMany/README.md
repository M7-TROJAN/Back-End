### Understanding `SelectMany` in LINQ and Entity Framework Core

`SelectMany` is a powerful method in LINQ (Language Integrated Query) used to project each element of a sequence to an `IEnumerable<T>` (or other collection) and then flatten the resulting sequences into one sequence. This is particularly useful when working with collections of collections or when you need to perform operations that involve accessing nested collections.

#### Purpose of `SelectMany`

The main purpose of `SelectMany` is to flatten a sequence of sequences. In the context of a database, `SelectMany` can be used to query related entities in a way that results in a single flat list, rather than a list of lists.

#### Example and Explanation

Let's dive into the examples you've provided to understand how `SelectMany` works.

##### Query Syntax Example

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    // Query syntax
    // Fetching the names of participants who are enrolled in frontend courses (e.g., Angular, React)
    var frontendParticipants =
        from c in context.Courses
        where c.CourseName.Contains("frontend") // filter courses with names containing 'frontend'
        from s in c.Sections // for each course, get all related sections
        from p in s.Participants // for each section, get all related participants
        select new
        {
            ParticipantName = p.FullName // select the full name of each participant
        };

    foreach (var pName in frontendParticipants)
        Console.WriteLine(pName);
}
```

**How it works:**

1. **Course Filtering**: The query starts by filtering `Courses` where the `CourseName` contains "frontend". This might include courses like "Angular" or "React".
   
2. **Flattening Sections (`SelectMany`)**: The `from s in c.Sections` line effectively performs a `SelectMany`, flattening the collection of sections related to each course into a single sequence. This is akin to `SelectMany(c => c.Sections)` in method syntax.

3. **Flattening Participants (`SelectMany`)**: The `from p in s.Participants` line again performs a `SelectMany`, flattening the collection of participants related to each section into a single sequence.

4. **Projection**: Finally, the query projects the `FullName` of each participant.

##### Method Syntax Example

```csharp
using (var context = new AppDbContext())
{
    // Method syntax
    var frontendParticipants =
        context.Courses
        .Where(x => x.CourseName.Contains("frontend")) // filter courses with names containing 'frontend'
        .SelectMany(x => x.Sections) // flatten sections for each course
        .SelectMany(x => x.Participants) // flatten participants for each section
        .Select(p =>
            new
            {
                ParticipantName = p.FullName // select the full name of each participant
            });

    foreach (var pName in frontendParticipants)
        Console.WriteLine(pName);
}
```

**How it works:**

- **Filtering Courses**: The `.Where` method filters `Courses` based on the `CourseName`.
  
- **Flattening Sections**: `.SelectMany(x => x.Sections)` flattens all the `Sections` related to the filtered `Courses` into a single list.

- **Flattening Participants**: `.SelectMany(x => x.Participants)` flattens all the `Participants` related to those `Sections` into a single list.

- **Projection**: The final `.Select(p => new { ParticipantName = p.FullName })` projects the participant names into a new anonymous type.

##### SQL Translation

The LINQ query translates into a SQL query that joins the `Courses`, `Sections`, and `Participants` tables, filtering based on the `CourseName` and selecting the relevant participant information. The SQL query is optimized to perform these operations at the database level.

##### Key Points to Remember

- **SelectMany vs. Select**: 
  - `Select` is used to project each element of a sequence into a new form (e.g., transforming each element).
  - `SelectMany` is used when each element of the sequence is itself a sequence, and you want to flatten all these nested sequences into one sequence.

- **Usage in Navigation Properties**:
  - In EF Core, `SelectMany` is particularly useful when working with collections of related entities (like `Sections` of a `Course` or `Participants` of a `Section`).

- **Flattening**: 
  - Think of `SelectMany` as taking a list of lists and flattening it into a single list.

- **SQL Efficiency**: 
  - The SQL generated by `SelectMany` is often optimized, performing the equivalent of `INNER JOIN` operations to fetch related data.

#### Conclusion

`SelectMany` is a powerful tool for working with hierarchical data. It allows you to navigate and flatten nested collections, making it easier to work with complex data models, particularly in scenarios where entities have one-to-many or many-to-many relationships.
