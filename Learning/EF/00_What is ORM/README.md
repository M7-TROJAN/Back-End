### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

#### What is ORM?
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It allows developers to interact with a database using objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. ORMs provide a high-level abstraction over the database, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.

#### Importance of ORM
- **Productivity**: ORMs automate repetitive database operations, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic.
- **Maintainability**: Using objects and classes makes the code more readable and maintainable.
- **Portability**: ORMs abstract the database layer, making it easier to switch between different databases with minimal changes to the code.

#### How ORM Works
ORM tools map classes in an object-oriented programming language to database tables, and instances of these classes to rows in those tables. Hereâ€™s a basic overview of how an ORM works:

1. **Mapping**: Define mappings between classes and database tables.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations using objects.
3. **Querying**: Use high-level query languages (e.g., LINQ in .NET) to retrieve data.

#### Common ORM Frameworks
- **Entity Framework (EF)**: A popular ORM for .NET applications.
- **Hibernate**: A widely-used ORM for Java applications.
- **Django ORM**: An ORM built into the Django web framework for Python.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A powerful ORM for Python applications.

### Entity Framework (EF)
Entity Framework (EF) is a widely-used ORM framework for .NET applications. It allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need to write most of the data access code.

#### Key Features of Entity Framework
- **Code First**: Define your model using C# classes and let EF generate the database schema.
- **Database First**: Generate C# classes based on an existing database schema.
- **Model First**: Create a visual model and generate both the database schema and C# classes.
- **LINQ Integration**: Use LINQ (Language Integrated Query) to query the database in a strongly-typed manner.

### Practical Example Using Entity Framework

#### Step 1: Define the Model
Create a C# class that represents a table in your database.

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

#### Step 2: Create the DbContext
A `DbContext` class manages the connection to the database and is used to query and save data.

```csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class SchoolContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=SchoolDB;Trusted_Connection=True;");
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Add Migrations
Entity Framework uses migrations to keep the database schema in sync with the model.

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

#### Step 4: Perform CRUD Operations

- **Create**:
    ```csharp
    using (var context = new SchoolContext())
    {
        var student = new Student { Name = "John Doe", Age = 18 };
        context.Students.Add(student);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
    ```

- **Read**:
    ```csharp
    using (var context = new SchoolContext())
    {
        var students = context.Students.ToList();
        foreach (var student in students)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"ID: {student.Id}, Name: {student.Name}, Age: {student.Age}");
        }
    }
    ```

- **Update**:
    ```csharp
    using (var context = new SchoolContext())
    {
        var student = context.Students.First();
        student.Age = 21;
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
    ```

- **Delete**:
    ```csharp
    using (var context = new SchoolContext())
    {
        var student = context.Students.First();
        context.Students.Remove(student);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
    ```

### Summary
ORM simplifies data management in applications by allowing developers to interact with databases using objects. Entity Framework is a powerful ORM for .NET applications, providing various ways to define models and interact with databases through high-level abstractions. By understanding and using ORM, developers can write cleaner, more maintainable, and database-agnostic code.
