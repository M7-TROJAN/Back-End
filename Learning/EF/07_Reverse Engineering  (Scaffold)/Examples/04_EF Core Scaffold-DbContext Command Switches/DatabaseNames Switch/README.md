The `-UseDatabaseNames` switch in the `Scaffold-DbContext` command tells Entity Framework Core to use the exact names from the database for the generated entity types and their properties. This switch ensures that the names in your C# code match the names in your database schema without any modification.

### What Happens Without `-UseDatabaseNames`

Without the `-UseDatabaseNames` switch, Entity Framework Core applies certain conventions to modify the names of the database objects to follow C# naming conventions. For example:
- Table names are converted to singular form.
- Column names are converted to PascalCase.

### What Happens With `-UseDatabaseNames`

With the `-UseDatabaseNames` switch, EF Core uses the names from the database exactly as they are. This can be particularly useful when:
- You want to maintain consistency between your database schema and your code.
- Your database naming conventions are already in a format that you want to preserve in your code.

### Example

Consider a database schema with the following naming conventions:

- Table Name: `tbl_speakers`
- Column Names: `first_name`, `last_name`

#### Without `-UseDatabaseNames`

The generated code might look like this:
```csharp
public partial class Speaker
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; } = null!;
    public string LastName { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

Here, EF Core applies its naming conventions:
- The table name `tbl_speakers` is converted to the class name `Speaker`.
- The column names `first_name` and `last_name` are converted to `FirstName` and `LastName`.

#### With `-UseDatabaseNames`

The generated code would look like this:
```csharp
public partial class tbl_speakers
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string first_name { get; set; } = null!;
    public string last_name { get; set; } = null!;
}
```

Here, EF Core uses the exact names from the database:
- The table name `tbl_speakers` is used as the class name.
- The column names `first_name` and `last_name` are used as the property names.

### Command Usage

The command to scaffold with `-UseDatabaseNames` would be:

```bash
Scaffold-DbContext "Data Source=M7_TROJAN;Initial Catalog=TechTalk;Integrated Security=SSPI;TrustServerCertificate=True" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -UseDatabaseNames
```

### Summary

- The `-UseDatabaseNames` switch ensures that EF Core uses the exact names from the database schema in the generated entity classes.
- It helps maintain consistency between the database and the code.
- Without this switch, EF Core applies naming conventions to the generated entity classes and properties.
